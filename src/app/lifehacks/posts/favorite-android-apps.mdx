## Podcasts I Listen To

### The Privacy, Security, and OSINT Show

## Health & Fitness

**Why I love it:** Comprehensive fitness and health tracking paired with my Garmin watch. Detailed activity metrics, sleep tracking, and training insights all in one place.

## The Core Principle

I'm very selective about apps I install. Each app must:
1. Solve a real problem in my life
2. Respect privacy (open-source preferred)
3. Work reliably without constant maintenance
4. Justify the storage space and permissions it needs

Quality over quantity. My phone is a tool, not a distraction machine.
